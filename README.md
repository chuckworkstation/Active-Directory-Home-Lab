# 🖥️ Active Directory Home Lab (From Scratch)

Welcome to my **Active Directory Home Lab** project! This lab was built entirely from scratch in my home environment to simulate real-world Identity and Access Management (IAM) scenarios using **Windows Server** and **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**.

I walk you through the setup and configuration of a domain controller as the foundation for hands-on AD tasks like user/group management, OU design, and Group Policy.

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

* Build a virtual lab environment
* Install Windows Server and configure networking
* Install the AD DS role
